I want to make the source code for this post-pitch app I created publicly available.
However, since it is very connected to my firebase account, google cloud account, and amazon account, and I removed all API keys/ID numbers 
it would be difficult to clone this repository and run the code locally. (feel free to try if you want.)


# Here are some scripts you might need when running the app.

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

ngrok start --config=ngrok.yml --all

1. npm run dev
2. NEW TERMINAL
    a. cd flask_server
    b. go to main.py and click run (on the same terminal you cd ed into)
